# Disclaimer

This little application was put together in a bit of a rush and doesn't follow a lot of what I'd consider to be industry standards (**_Whoops_**). So by all means make use of it, but try not to see the code remotely as an example of how you should be writing this kind of application. If anybody want's to raise issues for areas of improvement please feel free and I'll get around to bringing them back upto standard.
